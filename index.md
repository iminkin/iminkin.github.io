## Bio

I am currently a postdoctoral associate at Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Victoria Popic's group.
Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow with [Steven L. Salzberg](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/people/faculty/steven-l-salzberg/) at Johns Hopkins University, where I worked on improving gene annotations using evolutionary evidence.
I also completed a Ph.D. with [Paul Medvedev](https://medvedevgroup.com/principal-investigator/) at Pennsylvania State University, where I performed research on genome graphs and whole-genome alignment.
Before that, I graduated with an M.Sc. from Alferov University (formerly Saint-Petersburg Academic University) in Saint-Petersburg, Russia.
My master's thesis focused on synteny detection in bacterial genomes using de Bruijn graphs, a project supervised by [Son Pham](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~kspham/).
In between my Ph.D. and M.Sc. studies, I worked as a Research Assistant in the group of [Francis Chin](https://www.cs.hku.hk/index.php/people/academic-staff/chin) at the University of Hong Kong.
