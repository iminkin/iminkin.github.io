## Bio

I am a postdoctoral fellow with [Steven L. Salzberg](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/people/faculty/steven-l-salzberg/) at Johns Hopkins University.
My current work is focused on improving gene annotations using evolutionary evidence.
I also completed a Ph.D. with [Paul Medvedev](https://medvedevgroup.com/principal-investigator/) at Pennsylvania State University, where I performed research on genome graphs and whole-genome alignment.
Prior to that, I graduated with an M.Sc. from Alferov University (former Saint-Petersburg Academic University) in Saint-Peterburg, Russia.
My master's thesis focused in synteny detection in bacterial genomes using de Bruijn grahps, a project supervised by [Son Pham](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~kspham/).


## Research Interests

- **Computational Biology/Bioinformatics:** comparative genomics, sequence alignment, graph genomes, genome annotation
